; The smallest-divisor procedure shown at the start of this section
; does lots of needless testing: After it checks to see if the number
; is divisible by 2 there is no point in checking to see if it is
; divisible by any larger even numbers. This suggests that the values
; used for test-divisor should not be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., but rather
; 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, .... To implement this change, define a procedure
; next that returns 3 if its input is equal to 2 and otherwise returns
; its input plus 2. Modify the smallest-divisor procedure to use (next
; test-divisor) instead of (+ test-divisor 1). With timed-prime-test
; incorporating this modified version of smallest-divisor, run the
; test for each of the 12 primes found in exercise 1.22. Since this
; modification halves the number of test steps, you should expect it
; to run about twice as fast. Is this expectation confirmed? If not,
; what is the observed ratio of the speeds of the two algorithms, and
; how do you explain the fact that it is different from 2?


; Edited version of smallest-divisor to use new "next" procedure:

(define (smallest-divisor n)
  (find-divisor n 2))

(define (find-divisor n test-divisor)
  (cond ((> (square test-divisor) n) n)
        ((divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor)
        (else (find-divisor n (next test-divisor)))))

(define (next d)
   (if (= d 2) 
       3
       (+ d 2)))

(define (divides? a b)
  (= (remainder b a) 0))

(define (prime? n)
  (= n (smallest-divisor n)))


; timed-prime-test procedure from Exercise 1.22:

(define (timed-prime-test n)
  (newline)
  (display n)
  (start-prime-test n (runtime)))

(define (start-prime-test n start-time)
  (if (prime? n)
      (report-prime (- (runtime) start-time))))

(define (report-prime elapsed-time)
  (display " *** ")
  (display elapsed-time))

(define (search-for-primes l n)
   (if (even? l)
       (sfp (+ l 1) n)
       (sfp l n)))

(define (sfp l n)
   (cond ((= n 0) '())
         ((prime? l) (sub-sfp l n))
         (else (sfp (+ l 2) n))))

(define (sub-sfp l n)
   (timed-prime-test l)
   (sfp (+ l 2) (- n 1)))

(define (even? n)
  (= (remainder n 2) 0))
