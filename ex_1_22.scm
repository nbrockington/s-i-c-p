; Most Lisp implementations include a primitive called runtime that
; returns an integer that specifies the amount of time the system has
; been running (measured, for example, in microseconds). The following
; timed-prime-test procedure, when called with an integer n, prints n
; and checks to see if n is prime. If n is prime, the procedure prints
; three asterisks followed by the amount of time used in performing
; the test.

; Using this procedure, write a procedure search-for-primes that
; checks the primality of consecutive odd integers in a specified
; range. Use your procedure to find the three smallest primes larger
; than 1000; larger than 10,000; larger than 100,000; larger than
; 1,000,000. Note the time needed to test each prime. Since the
; testing algorithm has order of growth of (n), you should expect that
; testing for primes around 10,000 should take about 10 times as long
; as testing for primes around 1000. Do your timing data bear this
; out? How well do the data for 100,000 and 1,000,000 support the n
; prediction? Is your result compatible with the notion that programs
; on your machine run in time proportional to the number of steps
; required for the computation?
