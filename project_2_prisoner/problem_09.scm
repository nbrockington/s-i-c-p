;;  The play-loop procedure takes as its  arguments two prisoner's                    
;;  dilemma strategies, and plays an iterated game of approximately                   
;;  one hundred rounds.  A strategy is a procedure that takes                         
;;  two arguments: a history of the player's previous plays and                       
;;  a history of the other player's previous plays.  The procedure                    
;;  returns either a "c" for cooperate or a "d" for defect.
