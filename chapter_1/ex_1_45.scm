; We saw in section 1.3.3 that attempting to compute square roots by
; naively finding a fixed point of y -> x/y does not converge, and
; that this can be fixed by average damping. The same method works for
; finding cube roots as fixed points of the average-damped y ->
; x/y2. Unfortunately, the process does not work for fourth roots -- a
; single average damp is not enough to make a fixed-point search for y
; -> x/y3 converge. On the other hand, if we average damp twice (i.e.,
; use the average damp of the average damp of y -> x/y3) the
; fixed-point search does converge. Do some experiments to determine
; how many average damps are required to compute nth roots as a
; fixed-point search based upon repeated average damping of y ->
; x/yn-1. Use this to implement a simple procedure for computing nth
; roots using fixed-point, average-damp, and the repeated procedure of
; exercise 1.43. Assume that any arithmetic operations you need are
; available as primitives.
