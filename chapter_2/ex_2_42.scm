; The ``eight-queens puzzle'' asks how to place eight queens on a
; chessboard so that no queen is in check from any other (i.e., no two
; queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal). One possible
; solution is shown in figure 2.8. One way to solve the puzzle is to
; work across the board, placing a queen in each column. Once we have
; placed k - 1 queens, we must place the kth queen in a position where
; it does not check any of the queens already on the board. We can
; formulate this approach recursively: Assume that we have already
; generated the sequence of all possible ways to place k - 1 queens in
; the first k - 1 columns of the board. For each of these ways,
; generate an extended set of positions by placing a queen in each row
; of the kth column. Now filter these, keeping only the positions for
; which the queen in the kth column is safe with respect to the other
; queens. This produces the sequence of all ways to place k queens in
; the first k columns. By continuing this process, we will produce not
; only one solution, but all solutions to the puzzle.
;
; We implement this solution as a procedure queens, which returns a
; sequence of all solutions to the problem of placing n queens on an
; nÃ— n chessboard. Queens has an internal procedure queen-cols that
; returns the sequence of all ways to place queens in the first k
; columns of the board.
; 
; In this procedure rest-of-queens is a way to place k - 1 queens in
; the first k - 1 columns, and new-row is a proposed row in which to
; place the queen for the kth column. Complete the program by
; implementing the representation for sets of board positions,
; including the procedure adjoin-position, which adjoins a new
; row-column position to a set of positions, and empty-board, which
; represents an empty set of positions. You must also write the
; procedure safe?, which determines for a set of positions, whether
; the queen in the kth column is safe with respect to the
; others. (Note that we need only check whether the new queen is safe
; -- the other queens are already guaranteed safe with respect to each
; other.)
